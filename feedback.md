# Feedback

Great job with making this trivia game uniquely yours! Your interface is very cool and the sound interactions are super fun! I like how you can switch between themes and how everything is responsive.  

Your code is pretty well organized and easy to navigate. There is definitely some room for DRY-ing up the code and I'd encourage you to go back and work on that a bit.  I think you overuse "ids" in your HTML a little bit and I'd consider only adding an id if it's needed for js functionality as most of the items with ids could be targeted just with a class or element name. I have made some edits and added a few comments in your code for areas to take a look at, but I think overall everything looks good!
